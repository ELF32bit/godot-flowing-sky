![Demonstration](screenshots/demonstration.gif)

Flow mapping is a shader programming technique capable of giving an illusion of motion to a static image.<br>
This shader simulates realistic wind flow with regard to perspective and distorts the provided panoramic sky.<br>
Wind direction and intensity can be changed during gameplay for more realism.<br>

## Features
* Cubemap and equirectangular panorama support.
* Pole distortion is hidden for equirectangular panoramas.
* Ground and sun masking for compatibility with existing skies.
